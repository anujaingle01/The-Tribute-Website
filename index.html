          <h2>Father of the Indian Constitution</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Dr. B. R. Ambedkar</b>, born on April 14, 1891, was a visionary
            leader, social reformer, and jurist who dedicated his life to the
            fight against social discrimination and injustice. As the chief
            architect of the Indian Constitution, he played a monumental role in
            shaping modern India's democratic framework. Ambedkar tirelessly
            advocated for the rights and empowerment of marginalized
            communities, particularly Dalits, also known as untouchables. His
            relentless efforts led to the inclusion of provisions for social
            equality, freedom, and justice in the Constitution. Beyond his
            legislative contributions, Ambedkar was a prolific writer and
            scholar, addressing issues of caste, religion, and human rights. His
            legacy continues to inspire generations, symbolizing the struggle
            for social justice and equality worldwide.
